# Assignment 5

## Python Print() Function

For all 3 exercises, create Python scripts as described in the exercise instructions. Save these scripts in separate files named A5En.py, where n is the exercise number. Submit all script files to Gradescope Assignment 5.

Upon submission, your scripts will automatically be graded for functional correctness.

All exercises are due by 11:59pm on the day indicated in the course schedule.  You may correct errors and resubmit your scripts as many times as you like before the due date.

> Ensure *__all__* `print()` functions are using f-strings.  For example:
```
print (f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
```




## EXERCISE 1
Write a Python script that prints the following four sentences on separate lines, exactly as shown, including all punctuation marks and upper/lower case letters:
```
Holy cow! I can't believe I'm programming a computer.
Scripting in Python is so "freakin" cool!
Perhaps someday I'll be a Python "guru".
Someday, I could get a job at spotify\reddit\tinder\alphabet.
```
## EXERCISE 2
Write a Python script that prints the following restaurant order receipt, exactly as shown, including all spacing and using tab characters to separate the two columns:

```
Food Item       Price
==========      =======
Cheeseburger    $ 4.99
+ Bacon         $ 1.00
Fries w/gravy   $ 2.59
Milkshake       $ 2.99
-------
Sub-total:      $ 11.57
Tax (13%):      $ 1.50
Total:          $ 13.07
```

> Notes: Your script does not need to have any variables or perform any calculations unless you're going for the bonus!

> ONLY USE TAB CHARACTERS - 2 CONSECUTIVE SPACES WILL FAIL ALL TESTS

### Exercise 2 - BONUS MARKS
Bonus marks will be awarded if you script does all the following things:
1. Food item prices are stored in variables matching their item (`cheeseburger`,`fries_w_gravy`, etc),
1. Those variables are used to print the food item prices,
1. The tax percentage is held in a variable named `tax`,
1. That variable is used to print the tax percentage, and
1. The printed `subtotal`, `tax`, and `total` are calculated by the script.
1. You will need to do some research to figure out how to perform the calculations and round the results to the nearest cent, since we have not yet covered these aspects of Python scripting in the course, but we will soon.

## EXERCISE 3

Write a Python script that creates the following four variables:
```
colour = "red"
flower = "violet"
verb = "are"
line_num = 32
```

And uses the above variables as much as possible to print the following poem exactly as shown:
```
roses are red,
violets are blue,
unexpected '{'
on line 32.
```

## SUBMISSION

3 files named `A5E1.py`, `A5E2.py`,`A5E3.py`

## NOTES AND ADVICE

1. Pay special attention to where the lines begin and end.  
1. Read the error output and find the extra `\n` or `\t` before emailing and asking for answers.
1. The assignments are getting more trivial but my spoonfeeding help is going to start going down, make sure you learn this stuff. 
1. Don't be afraid to challenge the auto-grader and don't be afraid to learn that it's right. 
1. Typos are the emeny.
1. Tabs are not spaces.
1. Submit exactly what's asked. 
1. Read the instructions. 
1. Do not fold or bend this document. 

## USING AI

Just stop doing it.  Seriously.  You're not doing yourself any favours.  I can't stop you but I can get clever and watch everything burn just for fun.  We're using Python 3.11 and that came out after ChatGPT's dataset.  Maybe I slid some newer syntax in here?
